<div>Species of \textit{Casparya} are most abundant in wet forest throughout Northern Andes, where they frequently colonize areas above streams. Few species are successful in colonizing paramo, and only \textit{B. ursina} grows in open areas (“Pajonal”). Other species growing in high mountain ecosystems occupy mainly borders of forest. Most species form extremely local populations that range in size from a few to tens of individuals. As has been studied for species in other regions and sections, these localized populations may result from poor seed dispersal <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Dewitte2012}</cite></div>
