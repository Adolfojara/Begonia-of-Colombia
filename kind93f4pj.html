<div>Species of <i>Casparya</i> are most abundant in wet forest throughout Northern Andes, where they frequently colonize areas above streams. Few species are successful in colonizing paramo, and only \textit{B. ursina} grows in open areas (“Pajonal”). Other species growing in high mountain ecosystems occupy mainly borders of forest. Most species form extremely local populations that range in size from a few to tens of individuals. As has been studied for species in other regions and sections, these localized populations may result from poor seed dispersal <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Dewitte2012}</cite>.
</div><div>
</div><div>Seed dispersal in <i>Casparya</i> may be even more limited than in other sections, where the wings enhance the seed expulsion <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{faegri1979principles}</cite>. The precise mechanism of seed dispersion have not been reveled yet in <i>Casparya</i>, however because the lack of wings, the position of the dehiscence, and the ornamentation in the testa the most probable mechanism is rain ballistic dispersal. Change from wind to water as dispersal mechanism have sense for a group that inhabit mostly in the understory of wet forest, with high levels of rain and low wind energy. </div><h2 data-label="257703" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><h2 data-label="257703" class="ltx_title_subsection">Morphology</h2><h3 data-label="565789" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Habit</h3><div>Species in section <i>Casparya</i> are ever caulescent, long lived perennials, being \textit{Begonia diffusa} L.B.Sm. &amp; B.G.Schub. the smaller one, with ca. 20 cm high and \textit{Begonia ferruginea} L.f. the biggest one growing up to 3 m. Most of the species are subfrutescents, some of these are usually reclined (e.g. <i>Begonia umbellata</i>). The internodes are usually sparsely lenticellate and range from glabrous to hirsute, with hairs rarely glandular.</div><div></div><h3 data-label="766997" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Indument</h3><div>Descriptions of the indumentum and hair types fallows&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{hewson1988plant}</cite>. Species in <i>Casparya</i> display a limited variety of forms, being of little taxonomic value to species delimitation. The most notable variation is the presence of glandular hairs in <i>Begonia oleosa</i> Jara. Field observations have reveled high intra-specific variation in density of the pubescence, for example in <i>Begonia tetrandra</i> Irmsch. the same population have some individual glabrous and others densely pubescent.&nbsp;</div><h1></h1><h3 data-label="462562" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Leaves</h3><div>Leaf morphology in&nbsp;<i>Begonia</i>  is characterized by a dominant asymmetry, however in&nbsp;<i>Begonia solaniflora</i> the leaves are almost symmetrical. In most of the species of&nbsp;<i>Casparya</i> the leaves are similar to other sections of <i>Begonia</i> as <i>Ruizopavonia</i> or <i>Cyathoctemys</i>, and the petiole insert to the lamina obliquely to transversely. The transverse or oblique lamina may be a compromise between efficiency and mechanical cost, minimizing the necessity for secondary support tissue while optimizing water and nutrient transport by approaching a radial transport system (Givnish, 1979). Only <i>Begonia trujillesis</i> L.B. Sm. from Venezuela have peltate leaves, which is a rate condition in <i>Begonia</i>, founded most frequently in section <i>Gobenia</i>.
Leaf blades in <i>Casparya</i> are persistent, and in most species are coriaceous or membranaceous, being the species inhabiting in lower and pluvial regions more frequently membranaceous than species of high elevations. The leaves are medium to dark green on the adaxial surface, and generally lighter beneath, becoming red on the abaxial surface in species growing in shadow places, as <i>Begonia kalbreyeri</i> (Oliv.) L.B. Sm. &amp; B.G. Schub. However this is a character of little taxonomic value because is polymorph, and probably is affected by the local light availability.</div><div></div><h3 data-label="420407" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Inflorescence</h3><div>Inflorescences of all species in&nbsp;<i>Casparya</i> are borne laterally from axils of mature or immature leaves. Usually, they are bisexual, with few cases of unisexual inflorescences; B. ursina is a dioic species, and probably <i>Begonia wilburii </i>is also dioecious. Some species have dichotomic cymes and other have cincinnum. Generally, the central flower of dichotomic cymes is staminate, but in some cases the central flower is missing at the first node. In several species the first nodes are largely symmetric, but the last nodes have compressed internodes and unilateral cymes.</div><div></div><h3 data-label="450632" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Flowers</h3><div>Flowers in \textit{Casparya} usually have a well differentiated perianth, as in many sections. This was recognized \cite{de1859memoire} who referred to parts as sepals and petals in staminate flowers, but described pistillate flowers as being lobed. Neither \citep{Warburg1894} not \citep{Irmsher1925} followed Candolle but rather unified terminology by referring to perianth parts collectively as tepals. While \citep{smith1946begoniaceae} state they were able to recognize two distinctive perianth series in staminate flowers, they continued used the term tepals. However, in posterior publications they used sepals and petals to describe its perianth (e.g. \cite{smith1973begonia}).</div><div></div><h3 data-label="856195" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Fruits</h3><div>Fruits of \textit{Casparya} are loculicide capsules that open along slits at the base of each locule. Even after capsules loss their seeds, their continue hanging in the senescient inflorescence.</div><div></div><h3 data-label="601802" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Seeds</h3><div>A comprehensive comparative study of seed morphology was conducted by De Lange $\&amp;$ Bouman (1999). They recognize that the seed of \textit{Casparya} have a cuticle with a double structure, and many species have a rough surface.</div><div></div><h1>Materials &amp; Methods</h1><div>We examined by standard procedures a total of about 400 specimens and illustrations deposited or borrowed from the following herbaria CUVC, COL, FMB, JAUM, HUA, JBB, K, MO, UDBC, and US.
