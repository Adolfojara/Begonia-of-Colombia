                                  Type species is only known  from the type collection at the Paramillo region (ca. 2100 to 2400 m), in  department of Antioquia, at the extreme north of the Cordillera Occidental and  probably close to the current National Park "Paramillo". Several  collections of the specie with morphological variation have being collected on  the best sampled Orquideas National Park, about 50 km to the south. These  populations shows variation on hairs density being in general less pubescents  than the type specimen and are placed here under the new variety named B.  kalbreyeri var. orquidensis.        </div><div>
