<h1 data-label="108982" class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div>Section&nbsp;<i>Casparya</i> (Begonia, Begoniaceae), is one of the most diverse sections of the genus in America, with near 50 species, being Colombia the country with the most the species. The sections is phylogenetically well supported, and have morphological diagnostic characters that allows to be recognized clearly. The morphology of the fruit is the most taxonomically relevant character to identify this section, in&nbsp;<i>Casparya</i> the aperture of the carpels occurs in the back side, so that when the fruit is rape and pendant the aperture is upward, in contrast, the closer sections have fruit that open longitudinally on both sides of each wing. Additionally, the fruits in <i>Casparya</i> have no three typical wing as in most of American begonias, but instead have three fleshy horns in lateral position, and frequently at the apex there is a extension of the central axis that usually is call "column".</div><div></div><h2 data-label="712337" class="ltx_title_subsection">Taxonomic history</h2><div>Section&nbsp;<i>Casparya</i> was originally treated as a genus, along with other 38 genus that conformed the family Begoniaceae in the monographs of&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Klotzsch1855}</cite>. The species that were known at the moment, currently included in&nbsp;<i>Casparya</i>, where also included in other three genera (<span class="au-background-yellow" data-background="true">see table \ref{tab:addlabel})</span>. In the monograph of the Family by&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{DeCandolle1859}</cite>,&nbsp; most of the genera of Begoniaceae where relegated to sections of \textit{Begonia}, except for <i>Mezierea</i> Gaudish. and <i>Casparya</i>, because the kind of dehiscence of the fruits, and all the Klotzsch's genus that included species of&nbsp;<i>Casparya</i> where included as sections, and five additional sections where included, three of them had not species currently included in <i>Casparya</i>, see table <span class="au-background-yellow" data-background="true">\ref{tab:addlabel}</span>.</div><div></div><div></div><div><table>   <tbody><tr>    <td>    <div>Family</div>    </td>    <td>    <div>Genus</div>    </td>    <td>    <div>Species included</div>    </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>    <div>Begoniaceae</div>    </td>    <td>    <div>Stiradotheca Klotzsch</div>    </td>    <td>    <div>Stiradotheca magnifica, S. ferruginea,    S. trachyptera</div>    </td>   </tr>   <tr>    <td>    <div>&nbsp;</div>    </td>    <td>    <div>Casparya Klotzsch</div>    </td>    <td>    <div>Casparya hirta, C. coccinea (= B.    urticae), C. columnaris    (= B. urticae), C. elegans, (=B. foliosa (sect.
