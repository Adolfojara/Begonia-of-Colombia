<h1 data-label="108982" class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div>Section&nbsp;<i>Casparya</i> (Begonia, Begoniaceae), is one of the most diverse sections of the genus in America, with near 50 species, being Colombia the country with the most the species. The sections is phylogenetically well supported, and have morphological diagnostic characters that allows to be recognized clearly. The morphology of the fruit is the most taxonomically relevant character to identify this section, in&nbsp;<i>Casparya</i> the aperture of the carpels occurs in the back side, so that when the fruit is rape and pendant the aperture is upward, in contrast, the closer sections have fruit that open longitudinally on both sides of each wing. Additionally, the fruits in <i>Casparya</i> have no three typical wing as in most of American begonias, but instead have three fleshy horns in lateral position, and frequently at the apex there is a extension of the central axis that usually is call "column".</div><h2 data-label="712337" class="ltx_title_subsection">Taxonomic history</h2><div>Section \textit{Casparya} was originally treated as a genus, along with other 38 genus that conformed the family Begoniaceae in the monographs of \cite{Klotzsch1855}. The species that were known at the moment, currently included in \textit{Casparya}, where also included in other three genera (see table \ref{tab:addlabel}). In the monograph of the Family by \cite{DeCandolle1859},&nbsp; most of the genera of Begoniaceae where relegated to sections of \textit{Begonia}, except for \textit{Mezierea} Gaudish. and \textit{Casparya}, because the kind of dehiscence of the fruits, and all the Klotzsch's genus that included species of \textit{Casparya} where included as sections, and five additional sections where included, three of them had not species currently included in \textit{Casparya}, see table \ref{tab:addlabel}. 
</div><div></div><div>Sections <i>Semibegoniella</i> C.DC. was proposed to include species with gamophyllous perianth from America, and&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="834836" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><h2 data-label="834836" class="ltx_title_subsection">Phylogeny and classification</h2><div><i>Casparya</i> was formerly treated as a separate section from&nbsp;<i>Semibegoniella</i>, even when both section share the same kind of fruit. Support for separation of&nbsp;<i>Semibegoniella</i> was based on the apophyllous perianth, simple placenta (vs. bifid). However there were difficulties with the placement of some species that have intermediate characteres, as the case of&nbsp;<i>Begonia killipiana</i>, with red flowers but bifid placenta, or \textit{Begonia urticae} that can have both types of placenta.&nbsp; 
As show by&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Jara_Mu_oz_2019}</cite>, there are four main clades in Casparya that can be recognized according to morphological characters. Table XX shows a summary of the most relevant characters that define each clade.</div><div></div><h2 data-label="952810" class="ltx_title_subsection">Habitat and&nbsp; distribution</h2><div><i>Casparya</i> ranges from the Province of Limón in Costa Rica to the state of Junín in Perú. In Central America there is only the endemic species, \textit{Begonia wilburii} Burt-Utley $\&amp;$ Utley, and the wide distributed \textit{Begonia urticae} L.f. The pluvial region in the west of Colombia to north-west Ecuador, include mainly species formerly included in the section \textit{Semibegoniella}. The north of the Colombian eastern Cordillera and cordillera de Mérida, include are the richer area, with the number of species decreasing to the south. In Peru there are one endemic species \textit{Begonia hirta} (Klotzsch) L.B. Sm. $\&amp;$ B.G. Schub., and \textit{B. urticae}.
</div><div>\textit{Casparya} species occurs primarily in well conserved forest from 500 to 3.500 m (Figure 2), more than two-thirds of the species have mean elevations between 2.000 and 3.000 m. The species that grow at lower elevations are \textit{Begonia irmscheri} L.B.Sm. $\&amp;$ B.G.Schub., \textit{Begonia libera} (L.B.Sm. &amp; B.G.Schub.) L.B.Sm. $\&amp;$ B.G.Schub. and \textit{Begonia valvata} L.B.Sm. $\&amp;$ B.G.Schub., all of these growing in very humid forest. Some species have broad elevation ranges, being \textit{B. urticae} the sidest, 1150–3340 m (2190 m), some species have narrow ranges as \textit{B. ursina} and \textit{B. irmscheri}, however most of the species have ranges narrower than 500 m, and there are not apparent relation between the median elevation and the size of the elevation range (Figure 3). </div>
