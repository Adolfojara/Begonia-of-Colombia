The sections is phyllogenetically well supported, and have morphological diagnostic characters that allows to be recognized clearly. The morphology of the fruit is the most taxonomically relevant character to identify this section, in \textit{Casparya} the aperture of the carpels occurs in the back side, so that when the fruit is rape and pendant the aperture is upward, in contrast, the closer sections have fruit that open longitudinally on both sides of each wing. Additionally, the fruits in \textit{Casparya} have no three typical wing as in most of American begonias, but instead have three fleshy horns in lateral position, and frequently at the apex there is a extension of the central axis that usually is call "column".</div>
