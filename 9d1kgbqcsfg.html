<div>Although all species in&nbsp;<i>Casparya</i> grow terrestrially, field observations show that some species as \textit{Begonia silverstonii} are capable to exploiting epiphytic or saxicolous habitats, for example growing on stones of streams. Those individuals whom grow epiphytically tend to colonize bases of trunks, but not higher most exposed canopy zones. Some species usually founded in ravines are frequently found growing in rocks next to mosses.</div><div></div>
