I maintain this variety because the consistent  precence of a type of hairs overside, symilar to the hairs in Begonia  logirostris but less abundant, one or two big hairs on each space between  secundaty veins. Differer from Begonia suaviola on the absence of tuberculate  pubescence on the leaves. </div><div>    <b>Habitat and distribution</b>:—  Grows on central part of the Cordillera Central on the western side. According  to MacDougal et al. 3848, this species grows is "common in wet gorges,  specially on rocks and humus/vertical slopes near stream". It has also  seen growing in forest border.        </div>
